# Loan-Financing
Developed a loan financing application using Java for backend processing, JDBC for database connectivity, RESTful APIs for client-server communication, Bootstrap for responsive frontend design, and MySQL for data management.

1. Developed distinct entities and APIs to link backend data models with the frontend interface, ensuring seamless data mapping and interaction.
2. Implemented role-based login options (User, Manager, Clerk) with appropriate access controls to manage different levels of functionality.
3. Configured JDBC for secure database connectivity, including safeguards to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
4. Integrated routing and validation on the frontend to manage navigation and ensure all form fields are correctly filled before submission.
5. Designed separate pages for user registration, loan adjudication, and repayment, each page following the logical sequence of the loan lifecycle with built-in approval checks.
6. Developed unit test cases for both frontend and backend components to verify the correctness of validation logic, including edge cases and error handling scenarios, ensuring robust and reliable functionality.
7. Implemented data validation with JavaScript on the frontend for form accuracy and Java on the backend to enforce data integrity and business rules before processing.
